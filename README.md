## How to use my code

With my code, you can:
* **Train your model from scratch** by running **python train.py**
* **Test your trained model** by running **python test.py**

## Trained models

You could find my trained model at **trained_models/color_lines.pth**
 
## Requirements

* **python 3.6**
* **PIL**
* **cv2**
* **pytorch** 
* **numpy**
* **pygame**
